# Monty-Hall-Simulation
Welcome to the **Monty Hall Simulation** project! This repository contains a simple web simulation of the famous Monty Hall problem.

### What is the Monty Hall Problem? :question:

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario where a contestant is asked to choose one of three doors. Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two doors are goats. After the contestant picks a door, the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door, revealing a goat. The contestant then has the option to stick with their original choice or switch to the other unopened door.

### How to Run the Simulation :computer:

To run this simulation, follow these simple steps:
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to start the simulation.
2.  Enter the number of trials in the input field.
3.  Click **Start Simulation** to see the results of sticking with your initial choice versus switching doors.
